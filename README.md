# Approval Voting

## Introduction
Approval voting is a kind of voting system where voters are able to approve any number of
candidates. Each voter casts a ballot which consists of a pair of candidates that the voter
approves and this information is stored in a text file where each line corresponds to a ballot.
Voters can choose to approve all the candidates or none.<br />

and empty ballots by traversing through the ballot text file and finally declare a winner.
